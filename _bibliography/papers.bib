  abstract    = {This paper introduces a method for simulating soil-structure coupling with water,
which involves a series of visual effects, including wet granular materials, seepage
flows, capillary action between grains, and dam breaking simulation. We develop a
seepage flow based SPH-DEM framework to handle soil and water particles interactions
through a momentum exchange term. In this framework, water is seen as a seepage flow
through porous media by Darcy's law; the seepage rate and the soil permeability are
manipulated according to drag coefficient and soil porosity. A water saturation-based
capillary model is used to capture various soil behaviors such as sandy soil and clay
soil. Furthermore, the capillary model can dynamically adjust liquid bridge forces
induced by surface tension between soil particles. The adhesion model describes the
attraction ability between soil surfaces and water particles to achieve various visual
effects for soil and water. Lastly, this framework can capture the complicated dam-breaking
scenarios caused by overtopping flow or internal seepage erosion that are challenging
to simulate.},
